## About Apps
usePopcorn is an application that serves to browse movies, rate them, and manage the list of watched movies. usePopcron is built using React.JS as the front-end and makes use of the OMDB API (Open Movie Database). Users can quickly find film information, including genre, cast, director, rating, and more. In the next stage of development, I plan to use Next.js and develop it like Netflix.
